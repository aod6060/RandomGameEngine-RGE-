# RandomGameEngine-RGB-
## What is this project.
This project is a simple game engine from scratch. I'm creating this for
a small video series on youtube. Basically this project will show almost
everything that goes into creating a 3D game engine. First off we're going
to get SDL working, then move to OpenGL 3.3 stuff. After that we'll figure
out during the video series.
