Agenda for Video 2
- Create a basic window for the engine
	- Create Window Singleton
		- During Init it should allow for these parameters
			- string caption,
			- int width,
			- int height,
			- App* app
		- It should have an update method for starting 
		  application heartbeat
		- It should have a release method for releasing
		  all memory stuff
		- It should have both getWidth, and getHeight method
		  so we can have the screen width and height from 
		  the class
		- We need some exit method to get out of the heart beat
	- Create IApp Iterface for our apps
		- init method for initing stuff
		- update method for variable updates
		- fixedUpdate for fixed updates
		- render method for rendering
		- release method for releasing stuff
		- This is assentially a callback interface.
- Create a scratch pad so we can do testing.
	- This will implement IApp
	- This will have all methods create 
	  from IApp
	- It will basically be a hello world example
	- This should be call ScratchPadApp and will
	  have its own .cpp, and .h files.
